# images-meteor-project
This is an example project I am creating to learn how to use Meteor.
## Objectives
Create a page that gives a list of images, displays these images with a title and description and allows for people to vote which image they like the best.
## Challenges
<ul>
  <li>
    Need to figure out how to break this app into separate components and show multiple components on the screen at once => Created a folder of components and am rendering the components in main.js by nesting them into an 'App' component
  </li>
  <li>
    Need a list of images to show => Created a static array of images and am using this <a href = "http://dummyimage.com/600x400">image </a> as a placeholder for now
  </li>
  <li> Need to figure out how to produce one "image detail" for each image we have
  </li>
</ul>
